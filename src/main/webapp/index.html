            <h1>API Documentation</h1>

            <p>
                This document describes the API used for the Reminders webservice example.
                All URLs below are relative and should be prefixed with
                <mark>https://glassfish-svanimpe.rhcloud.com/reminders/api</mark>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever the service returns a <span class="label label-warning">400 Bad Request</span>, the body of the response will contain one or more error names.
                See the corresponding domain rules to find out what exactly went wrong.
                The generic <span class="label label-default">JSON</span> error means that either your input was invalid JSON or you
                supplied a value of an incorrect type for one of the fields.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a id="credentials">Credentials</a></h2>
            
            <h3>Domain rules</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span class="label label-default">CREDENTIALS_USERNAME</span> Credentials must contain a username.</li>
                <li><span class="label label-default">CREDENTIALS_PASSWORD</span> Credentials must contain a password.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Checking your credentials</h3>
            
            <p>
                This resource is meant to facilitate implementing client-side login by allowing you to check your credentials
                before attempting to authenticate a request with them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do so, use the <span class="label label-primary">POST /credentials</span> command.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command expects input similar to:
            </p>          
<pre>
{
    "username" : "superuser",
    "password" : "supersecret"
}
</pre>
            <p>
                This command returns <span class="label label-success">200 OK</span> along with an array of roles for the given username,
                or <span class="label label-warning">400 Bad Request</span> if the input was invalid.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This command obviously does not require authentication.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a id="users">Users</a></h2>

            <h3>Domain rules</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span class="label label-default">USER_USERNAME</span> A username is required, must be unique, can only contain alphabetical characters and must be between 8 and 255 characters in size.</li>
                <li><span class="label label-default">USER_PASSWORD</span> A password is required and must be between 8 and 255 characters in size.</li>
                <li><span class="label label-default">USER_ROLES</span> Valid roles are <code>"user"</code> and <code>"administrator"</code>.</li>
                <li><span class="label label-default">USER_PICTURE</span>
                    A custom profile picture must be a PNG or JPEG image no larger than 2MB in size.
                    The image will be scaled down to a 200px by 200px PNG image.
                </li>
            </ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                This command returns <span class="label label-success">201 Created</span> upon success or <span class="label label-warning">400 Bad Request</span>
                if the input was invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command currently does not require authentication (anyone can create a user account).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Listing all users</h3>
            
            <p>
                To list all users, use the <span class="label label-primary">GET /users</span> command.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command should return <span class="label label-success">200 OK</span> with a body similar to:

        "username" : "someuser",
        "fullName" : "John Doe"
    }
]
</pre>
            <p>
                As <code>fullName</code> is optional, it will not be included if it is not known.
            </p>
            <p>
                This command does not require authentication (user information is public).

            </p>
            
            <p>
                As <code>fullName</code> is optional, it will not be included if it is not known.
